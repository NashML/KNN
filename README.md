K-nearest neighbors examples

Files:
ArrayExample.ipynb: 
   Demonstrate 1-nearest neighbor with a calibration table to calculate 
   directions of arrival for signals arriving at a circular antenna array.
   Finds the minimum phase distance between the table entries and a measured
   response.

ArrayExample.py:
   For the impatient, the same antenna array example exported to Python directly.
